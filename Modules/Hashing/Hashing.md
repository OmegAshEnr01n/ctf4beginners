#HASHING#


----------
[This](https://cyfor.engineering.nyu.edu/_modules/cryptography/)  link has some lessons for hashing including but it is fairly small so in order to get the hang of it check this out!

there are many hashing algorithms and you can use any using the command line.
I'm using md5sum.

For Image 1:

    md5sum 044c53841c1a84261b513211a680f2cef00cc0df06d1aa762cef4986544ee647_large.jpeg
  output:
  

    9bf703a2eb35f1c4537e5293ae043e30  044c53841c1a84261b513211a680f2cef00cc0df06d1aa762cef4986544ee647_large.jpeg
For Image 2

    md5sum 044c53841c1a84261b513211a680f2cef00cc0df06d1aa762cef4986544ee647_large.jpeg
output:

    1f145388c4e595a4bb7ab64f2308331f  044c53841c1a84261b513211a680f2cef00cc0df06d1aa762cef4986544ee647_large.jpeg

Although we used to images looking exactly the same and having same size they had different hashes which means that they are fundamentally different. That means that you cant trust what you see.
