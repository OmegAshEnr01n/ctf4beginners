#REVERSING#


----------
<pr>Reversing or reverse engineering is a topic which is fairly difficult to learn alone. Basic knowledge of C/C++ is essential. Reversing involves understanding of the executable binary (eg:.ELF,.EXE) at the most basic level.</pr>
 <br>
<pr>There are 2 main components to reversing:<br> 

- Debugging
- Disassembly
</pr>

If you are using windows then you should use IDA pro. For linux users there is a default debugger and disassembler provided by GNU.

But this book covers only basics so in order to practice you should try [this](https://microcorruption.com/login) website, its free!

Reversing is a very difficult topic to learn so patience is a must. You might not get it at the first attempt so try and try again. Also there is no need to finish learning the book, you can start the challenges after learning about functions.<br>
Cheers!
