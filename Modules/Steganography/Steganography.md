#STEGANOGRAPHY#


----------
Steganography is the practice of hiding certain text in some data files.
These data files can be pictures or even audio files.<br>
[This](https://cyfor.engineering.nyu.edu/topic/02-lsb-steganography/) link has some basics for steganography but there is actually a lot more to it. Your ability to work with hex dump plays a huge role here. So if you do get any file about which you dont know anything try checking hexdump. you can use some good looking GUI for that purpose. Also where ever you go you must try using <kbd>Ctrl+f</kbd> for finding flags that could be hidden. Try the challenges available!

If stuck in a challenge try opening the file in terminal using this command (it was very helpful for us!)  :
> strings {filename.ext}



<br>Cheers!
