#FILE FORENSICS#


----------
[This](https://cyfor.engineering.nyu.edu/_modules/file-forensics/)  link has some lessons for file forensics including file signatures and metadata although it is recommended that you do not limit your knowledge to this but expand your knowledge further by trying some file signature challenges.

Also try the challenge I added, <br>
Cheers!
