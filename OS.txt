I recommend using KALI linux 1.0/2.0 .
Its fairly useful because it has many preinstalled stuff that you will need. 
There are many ways to get it on your PC and here I have explained all the ways which i found to 
be neat and useful.

// IF YOU CHOOSE KALI LINUX 1.0 (DONT IGNORE IT JUST CUZ IT IS OLDER, I STILL USE IT :p)

1) virtual box

	This is the most efficient and best method because if there are any errors that occus in your pc or 
you end up messing up your NIC(a little) it wont be much of a worry cuz it is only on virtual box.
Virtual box is a software on which OSs' are virtually run, so you can run any other version of linux that you like as
well.

	To set this up you need to download an appropriate version of virtual box
	LINK: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
	click on the amd64/x86 hyperlink (BTW and64 is a processor architecture)

	Im not sure if 1.0 is available so ill put it up.
	
	Then you just install virtual box and click new.
	
	Name your machine whatever and choose the OS version
	SET it to about 1/2 of your total RAM or 1/4th of RAM.
	create a new virtual hard disk and dynamically allocate about 10 GB.
	Select settings for the new virtual machine > storage > sata drive add new
	give the address for your .iso image.

2) usb booting with persistence

	This is the method that I used. You will need a USB or hard drive - external.
Download and install minitool partition wizard. If it is recommended that you use 
the whole drive, if USB, and you wipe the drive. In this method the external drive acts as portable computer
which can be plugged into any computer and booted into. Partition the USB into 2(or3)
parts 
- 1 with 4 GB in fat32 format 
- 2 with the rest of the memory (only if it is USB, if it is an
external hard drive you can allocate as much as you want the OS drive space to be recommended:20GB) in ext2 format,
and label it persistence. <--- THIS IS IMPORTANT
(NOTE: this is the new OSs'drive memory)
- 3 (only if it is an external hard drive) rest of the memory in NTFS (NOTE: this is the memory that will still be available for use as an external hard drive.) 

	Next you need to get USB universal installer. -> http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/
	Now plug in your drive and open USB universal installer and follow the step for kali linux.
	Make sure that you install it into part 1 of the drive.
	Now you should turn off your computer and enter the BIOS, the method to which depends on the computer manufacturer.
	Once you enter your BIOS choose the drive into which linux was installed.

		
	Once you enter the drive you must realize that an OS is being booted from the external drive
	SO DONT REMOVE THE DRIVE UNTILL YOU TURN IT OFF.
	Select live amd64 for normal use (NOTE: in this mode any changes made wont be saved).
		
	To create a portable computer we need it to save changes to the drive itself, that is why the persistence partition was created.
		
	FOR PERSISTENCE:-
	
	- Firstly, boot into the drive and open it in live amd64(mostly not usb persistence but u can try that too) 
	- Dont do anything just open terminal
	- Open gparted and check if persistence is mounted to anything, if so unmount. Also check its address eg:/dev/sdb5
	- Then open terminal and type:
  		mkdir /mnt/usb
  		mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt/usb
  		echo "/ union" >> /mnt/usb/persistence.conf
  		umount /dev/sdb5
Restart it and this time open it in persistence.
Check in file system if there is a file called persistence.conf, if so then :').
 
// IF YOU CHOOSE KALI LINUX 2.0

1) virtual box

This is easier than in 1.0. Just open this link -> https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/
Here you can download the prebuilt image and all you have to do is double click the .ova file.
It will set itself up.
Make sure that you check setup.

2) usb booting with persistence

Just follow this link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQrQxVsXoh4
It explains everything well but in case you want to do this on an external hardrive and you want a third partition for your files,
all you need to do is create three pertitions instead of 2. Also make sure that the file systems(ie. NTFS, fat32..) is
applied to the partitions correctly.
fat32 - 4GB - for usb booting
ext2  - how much ever - for persistence
NTFS  - how much ever - for memory not related to linux, ie. for your movies or whatever.
